# How to print multi-frame images via the XtraPrinting Library


<p>This example demonstrates how to extract frames from multi-frame images and print them via the XtraPrinting Library.<br />
Each frame is wrapped in an instance of the Link class inheritor. Then, all Links are added to the CompositeLink class instance.<br />
In addition, you can specify whether it's necessary to make a page break after each image. Please refer to the source code for more information.</p>
